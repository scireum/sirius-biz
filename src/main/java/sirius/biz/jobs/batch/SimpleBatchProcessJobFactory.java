 * Note that this must only be used for very simple jobs with few or no parameters as no state must be stored in the
 * factory itself.

 * For more complext jobs which need to keep their parameters in fields and which also might want to split their
 * logic into several methods, subclass {@link BatchProcessJobFactory} (or its pre-defined sublcasses) and provide
