/**
 * Helps to distinguish an initial first attempt from a retry.
 * <p>
 * It can be used by any kind of io operation which are essentially expected to fail sometime, but which might
 * benefit from attempting a retry. Therefore, the helper method {@link #shouldThrow(Exception)}
 * can be used to determine if an <tt>IOException</tt> is swallowed if it occurs during a first attempt but
 * will be thrown during a retry.
 * <p>
 * The pattern to use this looks something like:
 * <pre>{@code
 * for(Attempt attempt : Attempt.values()) {
 *     try {
 *         ...do something
 *         return;
 *     } catch(Exception e) {
 *         if (attempt.shouldThrow(e)) {
 *             throw Exceptions.handle...
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * This approach permits to perform inner returns and also enables some optimizations to the compiler (as opposed to
 * using lambdas).
