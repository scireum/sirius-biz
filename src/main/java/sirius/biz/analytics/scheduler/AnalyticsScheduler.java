 * In charge of computing batches of entities which are then used to execute {@link AnalyticalTask analytical tasks} on

 * <p>
 * As most {@link AnalyticalTask tasks} are execute rather quickly, scheduling each single one of them provides
 * quite an overhead for the distributed tasks framework. Therefore, each scheduler computes batches of entities which
 * are then scheduled and executed at once.
 * <p>
 * This is a two stage process, {@link #scheduleBatches(Consumer)} emits a list of JSON specification which can
 * be used as descriptions in {@link sirius.biz.cluster.work.DistributedTasks}. Once being executed, the description
 * is forwarded to {@link #executeBatch(ObjectNode, LocalDate, int)} which collects all entities of the specified
 * batch. In most implementations the scheduler will then pick all matching {@link AnalyticalTask analytical tasks} and
 * executes them on the entity.
